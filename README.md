# Modelling and Analysis of a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows in Freight Delivery

## Introduction
A MSc's Dissertation Project which focuses on Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), using both exact method and heuristic approach (General Variable Neighbourhood Search - GVNS).

The exact approach is based on a classical Mix-Integer Programming (MIP) model and solved by IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.9. Both exact and heuristic algorithm are implemented by Python 3.7 and run on a ASUS Intel Core i7 with 1.8 GHz CPU and 8 GB RAM.

## Data
Both methodologies are first tested on the famous Solomon (1987) benchmark instances. The data is avalaible on [SINTEF](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/solomon-benchmark/).

Then, the methods are applied to solve an logistics problem in a UK-based company.
